# Djehuty: A Mixed-Initiative Handwriting Game for Preschoolers
## Context
Learning to read and write is a fundamental right and a necessary skill for the personal, cultural, and economic development of people and their societies. However, children of developing countries, such as sub-Saharan areas, are currently at a greater risk to grow illiterate. The current penetration of mobile technologies and the internet in sub-Saharan rural areas, however, offers a unique opportunity for tackling the challenge of literacy at a large scale. Motivated by the current shortage of preschool teachers for training handwriting in a personalised manner, we introduces Djehuty, an educational gamified environment for preschoolers. Djehuty is equipped with an artificial intelligence module which generates a style of handwriting and suggests handwriting paths to the child in a mixed-initiative manner. The text presents the key elements of the game prototype.

## Djehuty
Djehuty (better known by his Greek name: Thoth) is often represented by an ibis or a baboon. For the ancient Egyptians, he was the god of wisdom, writing, hieroglyphics, science and the arts. This is the name we have chosen for our interactive tutoring system to teach Latin alphabet handwriting to preschoolers. Djehuty is a gamified ITS or more simply an interactive tutoring game. As a game, it implements three features of gami ed systems: simplicity, feedback and real-time.

## Gamification features
The playerâ€™s objective in Djehuty is simple: to reproduce the letter drawn on the screen as accurately as possible. See GIF below for an indicative playthrough with Djehuty.
* The player can request the application to write a letter on the screen. The player can sample many examples of the same letter in real-time, by clicking on the refresh button.
* The player tries to replicate the letter she wants, by drawing on the screen.
* By clicking on the star button, the student gets a score in stars. The more accurate the replication, the higher the score. If the user got more than 3.5 stars the next letter is sampled with respect to the style of the user.
* The player can retry as many times as they want, as the AI produces a new letter after a player gets a score; otherwise, the player can exit to the main menu with the back button.
The goal is to achieve the highest score i.e to get as many stars as possible.
